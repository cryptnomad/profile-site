    <p>One of my favorite book series is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Uncle-Complete-11-Book-Latest-Editions/dp/B006YKEN4E">Uncle Eric</a> series by Richard Maybury. Maybury writes letters as 'Uncle Eric' to his imaginary teen nephew Chris about philosophy, politics, history, and economics. He masterfully simplifies complex concepts and develops frameworks for understanding the world that I continue to go back to as an adult.</p>
    <p>That is the inspiration for Bitcoin Bytes. As I learn more about decentralized technology and begin integrating it into my personal and professional life, I find myself trying to create generalized frameworks from basic concepts, in order to understand the technology as best I can. My hope is to create a library of building blocks for understanding the future of money.</p>
